### Serendipify.Me  -  Group Discover API for Mobile (Android) Integration

#### Introduction

[Serendipify.Me](http://serendipify.me) is a simple service developed to facilitate private interests matching is transient groups.

**You want this for your mobile application** if you intend to build a stronger user community, and to enable your users to discover common interests and initiate partnerships and friendships from within your application.

WE make available an API (detailed below) that implements the for group search, matching, and people discovery. Serendipify.Me is effectively the *Match.com* for your user base.

In this repository, we also provide you with a skeleton "Template App" to show you how to use the API. Presumably you identify relevant code, add and customize it for your app, and you will be ready to give your users this matching functionality. 

#### Details and Implementation Example

The Serendipify.Me API (configured to work with the "test" instance) consists of:
- group management functionality (performed by the group initiator)
 - create new group
 - add user to group

- user matching functionality (for your mobine app's users)
 - read my current matching interests
 - set new preferences
 - get the matching users
